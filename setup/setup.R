## Requirements------

### R version: 3.6.x or newer (recommend 4.0.x) and RStudio.
### Windows users: Please also download the Rtools version compatible with your R version https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/history.html (not for MacOS)

# Advanced Telemetry Workshop ONLY: You must install also GDAL software, which can take a long time. See the extra setup document provided.

# Once R/RStudio is installed: open RStudio and run this install script. Please run it line-by-line instead of all at once in case there are errors.

#Note: When running through the installs, you may encounter a prompt asking you to upgrade dependent packages.
      #Choosing Option `3: None`, works in most situations and will prevent upgrades of packages you weren't explicitly looking to upgrade.
