A quick intro to different analytical techniques that can be used for analyzing acoustic telemetry data. We’ll break statistics down into a three-point checklist - the goal, the response variable, and the method - and take a look at how each of these play a role in the statistical analysis of our data. We will have a brief intro into the main classes of statistics that can be used (e.g., GLMMs, network analysis, etc.), and examine how they are used by taking a look at the several examples from the literature
