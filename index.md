**NOTE:** this workshop has been update to align with OTN's 2025 Detection Extract Format. For older detection extracts, please see the this lesson: [Archived OTN Workshop](https://ocean-tracking-network.github.io/otn-workshop-2025-06/). 

This pair of workshops will introduce the R programming language, popular in the field of biologging.

In session one we will explore some of the popular software packages suitable for exploring and plotting acoustic telemetry data, including `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, for the purpose of generating summaries for reports.

The second session offers a brief overview of the `glatos` R package for performing detection filtering, various calculations and plotting. The data is then transformed for ingestion into the powerful acoustic telemetry packages `remora` and `actel`, along with examples from each package.
